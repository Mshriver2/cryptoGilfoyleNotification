## CryptoMemeNotification


This project resembles the remote bitcoin mining rig notification used by Gilfoyle in Silicon Valley. You can use your own custom sound files if you want something other than what is shown in this [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz7IPTf1uts).

This script lets you have seperate sound files for if your selected crypto has gone up or down. You provide the percentage price movement you want to be notified for you also set the time interval for how often it checks for that percentage movement you selected. Feel free to make some pull requests.
